                    <li>In the first week of the module, our teacher gave a brief overview of the curriculum, handed out the first assignment, and greeted a new student. The instructor reassured us that the task was doable, establishing a climate of accessibility and preparedness for the voyage ahead. </li>

With an emphasis on HTML and CSS basics, the instructor included students in interactive learning by asking one to show off their coding abilities and offering remedies for mistakes.</li>
